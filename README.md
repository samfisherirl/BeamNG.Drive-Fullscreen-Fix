BeamNG.Drive Fullscreen Fix


This application will apply the fullscreen config before opening BeamNG. If you alt tabbed to leave or exit beamng, your config file reads as windowed. It also requires alt enter every time you hop in. So Im here to fix that. 

Right now it's just an AHK file. I will be building a bat file that can replace BeamNG.Drive as a steam and desktop icon. 

For now, Run after launching or before, BeamNG. Within a couple hours I should have a GUI for install.

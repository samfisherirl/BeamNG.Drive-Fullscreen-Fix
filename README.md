BeamNG.Drive Fullscreen Fix

This application will apply the fullscreen config before opening BeamNG. If you alt tabbed to leave or exit beamng, your config file reads as windowed. It also requires alt enter every time you hop in. So Im here to fix that. Today's release isn't ready yet but I expect a release by sunday or monday with a full UI install and launcher.
